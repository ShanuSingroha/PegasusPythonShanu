#Pegasus is a new self-supervised pre-training objective for abstractive summarization, gap-sentences generation
The main goal of Pegasus text summarization is to generate accurate and concise summaries from input documents (s). 

Function : To Perform Abstractive Summarization
All the files related to the project can be found in :
(base) ubuntu@ip-172-31-31-101:~/work/from_shanu/PegasusPython$
To run the files we need to install sentence piece, transformers and Torchvision package.
To run the model we need to run the command : python filename.py.
Next, the program will download spiece.model, tokenizer_config.json, pytorch_model.bin files.
Now, we can input any text for which we want to generate the summary.
Finally, we will receive the Abstractive Summary of the text that we have entered.
